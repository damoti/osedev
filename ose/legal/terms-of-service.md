### The OSEDev Terms of Service
Effective date: September 1, 2017


### A. Definitions
**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the OSEDev Privacy Statement, available at [osedev.org/site/legal/privacy](/site/legal/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website.
2. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by OSEDev.
3. The “Website” refers to OSEDev’s website located at [osedev.org](https://osedev.org/), and all content, services, and products provided by OSEDev at or through the Website.
4. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the account; or that directs the use of the account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age.
5. “OSEDev,” “We,” and “Us” refer to OSEDev, as well as our affiliates, directors, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.

### B. Account Terms
**Short version:** *A human must create your account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one account. You alone are responsible for your account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your account. You are responsible for keeping your account secure.*

#### 1. Required Information
You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name and location, is optional.

#### 2. Account Requirements
We have a few simple rules for accounts on OSEDev's Service.
- You must be a human to create an account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted.
- One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one account.
- You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young volunteers get excited about contributing to Open Source Ecology, we must comply with United States law. OSEDev does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s account immediately](#m-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
- Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people.

#### 3. User Account Security
You are responsible for keeping your account secure while you use our Service.
- You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your account.
- You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. OSEDev cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
- You will promptly [notify OSEDev](mailto:admin@osedev.org) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your account, including any unauthorized use of your password or account.

#### 4. Additional Terms

The [Open Source Ecology Wiki general disclaimer](http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/Open_Source_Ecology:General_disclaimer) is also applicable to any user of OSEDev.

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of OSEDev. For example, you may download an application that integrates with OSEDev; or you may use OSEDev to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

### C. Acceptable Use
**Short version:** *OSEDev facilitates collaboration efforts from users all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow this Acceptable Use Policy, which includes some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

#### 1. Compliance with Laws and Regulations
Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

#### 2. Content Restrictions
You agree that you will not under any circumstances upload, post, host, or transmit any content that:

- is unlawful or promotes unlawful activities;
- is or contains sexually obscene content;
- is libelous, defamatory, or fraudulent;
- is discriminatory or abusive toward any individual or group;
- contains or installs any active malware or exploits, or uses our platform for exploit delivery (such as part of a command and control system); or
- infringes on any proprietary right of any party, including patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity, or other rights.

#### 3. Conduct Restrictions
While using OSEDev, you agree that you will not under any circumstances:
- harass, abuse, threaten, or incite violence towards any individual or group, including OSEDev employees, officers, and agents, or other OSEDev Users;
- use our servers for any form of excessive automated bulk activity (for example, spamming), or relay any other form of unsolicited advertising or solicitation through our servers, such as get-rich-quick schemes;
- attempt to disrupt or tamper with OSEDev's servers in ways that could harm our Website or Service, to place undue burden on OSEDev's servers through automated means, or to access OSEDev's Service in ways that exceed your authorization;
- impersonate any person or entity, including any of our employees or representatives, including through false association with OSEDev, or by fraudulently misrepresenting your identity or site's purpose; or
- violate the privacy of any third party, such as by posting another person's personal information without consent.

#### 4. Scraping
Scraping refers to extracting data from our Website via an automated process, such as a bot or webcrawler. It does not refer to the collection of information through OSEDev's API. Please see [Section H](#h-api-terms) for our API Terms. You may scrape the website for the following reasons:
- Researchers may scrape public, non-personal information from OSEDev for research purposes, only if any publications resulting from that research are open access.
- Archivists may scrape OSEDev for public data for archival purposes.

You may not scrape OSEDev for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling OSEDev users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of OSEDev data gathered through scraping must comply with the [OSEDev Privacy Statement](/site/legal/privacy).

#### 5. Privacy
Misuse of OSEDev Users' Personal Information is prohibited.

Any person, entity, or service collecting data from OSEDev must comply with the [OSEDev Privacy Statement](/site/legal/privacy), particularly in regards to the collection of our Users' Personal Information (as defined in the OSEDev Privacy Statement). If you collect any OSEDev User's Personal Information from OSEDev, you agree that you will only use the Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which our User has authorized it. You agree that you will reasonably secure any Personal Information you have gathered from OSEDev, and you will respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and "do not contact" requests from OSEDev or OSEDev Users.

#### 6. Excessive Bandwidth Use
If we determine your bandwidth usage to be significantly excessive in relation to other OSEDev users, we reserve the right to suspend your account or throttle your file hosting until you can reduce your bandwidth consumption.

#### 7. User Protection
You agree not to engage in activity that significantly harms our Users. We will resolve disputes in favor of protecting our Users as a whole.

### D. User-Generated Content
**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close accounts if we need to.*

#### 1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content
You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

#### 2. OSEDev May Remove Content
We do not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but we have the right (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any OSEDev terms or policies.

#### 3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants
You retain ownership of and responsibility for Content you create or own ("Your Content"). If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other OSEDev Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting OSEDev the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

#### 4. License Grant to Us
We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service. This includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant OSEDev the right to sell Your Content or otherwise distribute or use it outside of our provision of the Service.

#### 5. License Grant to Other Users
Any User-Generated Content you post, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' content, may be viewed by others. By posting, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your content (this means that others may make their own copies of your Content).

You grant each User of OSEDev a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the OSEDev Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on OSEDev as permitted through OSEDev's functionality (for example, through forking). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other OSEDev Users.

#### 6. License Grant to Open Source Ecology
You grant Open Source Ecology a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content on various platforms used by Open Source Ecology and to reproduce Your Content as permitted through OSEDev's functionality. If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to Open Source Ecology.

#### 7. Moral Rights
You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant OSEDev the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

### F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy
If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/site/legal/dmca-takedown-policy/). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on OSEDev violates your rights, please contact us by emailing admin@osedev.org. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the accounts of [repeat infringers](/site/legal/dmca-takedown-policy/#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

### H. API Terms
**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of OSEDev's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses OSEDev.*

#### 1. Limitation of Liability for API Use
You understand and agree that OSEDev is not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if OSEDev has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from your use of the API or third-party products that access data via the API.

#### 2. No Abuse or Overuse of the API
Abuse or excessively frequent requests to OSEDev via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account's access to the API. OSEDev, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed OSEDev's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from OSEDev for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling OSEDev users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the OSEDev API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [OSEDev Privacy Statement](/site/legal/privacy).

#### 3. OSEDev May Terminate Your Use of the API
We reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, your access to the API or any part of it with or without notice.

### K. Advertising on OSEDev
**Short version:** *We do not generally prohibit use of OSEDev for advertising. However, we expect our users to follow certain limitations, so OSEDev does not become a spam haven. No one wants that.*

#### 1. Spamming and Inappropriate Use of OSEDev
Advertising Content, like all Content, must not violate the law or these Terms of Use, for example through excessive bulk activity such as spamming. We reserve the right to remove any advertisements that, in our sole discretion, violate any OSEDev terms or policies.

### M. Cancellation and Termination
**Short version:** *You may close your account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.*

#### 1. Account Cancellation
It is your responsibility to properly cancel your account with OSEDev. You can cancel your account at any time by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel accounts in response to an email or phone request.

#### 2. Upon Cancellation
We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information can not be recovered once your account is cancelled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed or that other Users have forked.

#### 3. OSEDev May Terminate
OSEDev has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. OSEDev reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

#### 4. Survival
All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination will survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.

### N. Communications with OSEDev
**Short version:** *We use email and other electronic means to stay in touch with our users.*

#### 1. Electronic Communication Required
For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form via the email address you have submitted or via the Service; and (2) agree that all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that those communications would satisfy if they were on paper. This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

#### 2. Legal Notice to OSEDev Must Be in Writing
Communications made through email or OSEDev Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to OSEDev or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to OSEDev is required by contract or any law or regulation. Legal notice to OSEDev must be in writing and served on OSEDev's legal agent.

#### 3. No Phone Support
OSEDev only offers support via email, in-Service communications, and electronic messages. We do not offer telephone support.

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

### Q. Release and Indemnification

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that OSEDev (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases OSEDev of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

### R. Changes to These Terms
**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any changes that affect your rights and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website. For non-material modifications, your continued use of the Website constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms of Service.

We reserve the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Website (or any part of it) with or without notice.

Our rights under this Agreement will survive any termination of this Agreement.

#### 5. Amendments; Complete Agreement
This Agreement may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized representative of OSEDev, or by the posting by OSEDev of a revised version in accordance with [Section R.
